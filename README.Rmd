# Assignment 5 :smile:
## Data wrangling wrap up

- In this repository, you can find:
    * I completed the first two tasks
    * I commented some code in my md file as the output is only viewable in the html file.
    * This assignment is quite long so I used TOC which is helpful to navigate my md much quicker.
